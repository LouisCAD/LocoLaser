        {
            "type" : ("android" | "ios"),
            "res_name" : (String value),
            "res_dir" : (Path to dir),
            "temp_dir" : (Path to dir),

        "keep_new_platform" |
        "export_new_platform"
    ),
    "work_dir" : (Path to dir)
    "force_import" : (false | true),
    "duplicate_comments" : (false | true),
    "delay" : (Integer value)
}
```
##### Platform
Platform can be defined by single string("android" or "ios") or by JSON object.<br>
JSON object may contain following properties:<br>
- **`type`** - String. Type of the platform ("android" or "ios").
- **`res_name`** - String. Resource name.
  * Default Android: "strings",
  * Default iOS: "Localizable".
- **`res_dir`** - String. Path to resources directory.
  * Default Android: ".\\\\src\\\\main\\\\res\\\\",
  * Default iOS: ".\\\\".
- **`temp_dir`** - String. Path to directory with temporary files.
  * Default Android: ".\\\\build\\\\tmp\\\\",
  * Default iOS: ".\\\\tmp\\\\".
<br>
JSON object of the iOS platform has the extra properties:<br>
- **`swift_class`** - String. If not null Swift class will generated in source dir.
- **`objc_class`** - String. If not null Obj-C class will generated in source dir.
- **`source_dir`** - String. Path to directory with source files. By default used work dir.

##### Google Sheet
Google Sheet may contain following properties:<br>
- **`type`** - String. Type of the source. Must be "googlesheet". Not necessary property but if you want to be sure that you use right tool you should define it.
- **`id`** - String. ID of the Google Sheet. You can get it from sheet url (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/**sheet_id**).
- **`worksheet_title`** - Title of the worksheet with localized strings. Not necessary property, by default will used first worksheet of the sheet.
- **`column_key`** - String. Column title which contain string key's.
- **`column_locales`** - String array. Array of the column titles which contain localized strings. Column title will be used for locale name. First locale will import as base locale.

##### Other config properties
- **`work_dir`** - String. Path to work directory. Other related paths will be related to this work dir. By default is directory of the configuration file.
- **`force_import`** - Boolean. Import doesn't execute without a need, but if `force_import` is `true` import will be executed any way.
- **`conflict_strategy`** - String. Define which action should performed for conflicts. There is 3 actions:
  * `remove_platform` - Remove platform resources and replace it with resources from sheet. Default value.
  * `keep_new_platform` - Keep new platform resources if sheet doesn't contain this resources.
  * `export_new_platform` -  New platform resources should be exported into source if source doesn't contain this resources.
- **`duplicate_comments`** - Boolean. If false comment will not be written if it equal localized string. Default value false.
- **`delay`** - Long. Time in minutes that define delay for next localization. Localization will executed not more often the specified delay. If force import switch on delay will be ignored.

    "platform" : "android",

        "type" : "googlesheet",
        "column_key" : "key",
        "column_locales" : ["en", "fi"],
